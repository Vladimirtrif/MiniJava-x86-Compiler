1. Changes made to the grammar:
    We added non-terminals for parts of the grammar where there were non-terminals on the right hand side could repeat.
    We did this with right-recursion and all the non-terminals suffixed with "List" were done this way.
    For example, ExpList in our cup file represents is (Exp)* in the grammar.
    We also added precendence rules for BECOMES, AND, LESS, PLUS, MINUS, MULT, NOT, NEW, and DOT.

2. How we managed the work
    We pair programmed in the cse lab together so we did the entire part of this project together in person.
