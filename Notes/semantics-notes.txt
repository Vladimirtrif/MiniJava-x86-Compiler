1. Addtional checks or other extensions:
    We have no additional checks or extensions.

2. Changes made to previous parts:
    - We fixed all the errors in our parser
    - We changed our AST Node type to have a type field that holds the type of the AST Node so we can annotate the nodes.
      The default type is undefined but when we typecheck we change it to the correct type for nodes that require annotations
      (particularly expressions).

3. How we managed the work:
   We pair programmed in the cse lab together so we did the entire part of this project together in person.
